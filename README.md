# LinkedListImplementation

This repository contains Java implementations of various types of linked lists. These data structures are commonly used in computer science for dynamic memory storage and manipulation.

## 📁 Contents

- **DoublyLinkedList.java**  
  Implementation of a doubly linked list, where each node contains a reference to both the next and the previous node.

- **MergeLinkedList.java**  
  A utility class that merges two sorted singly linked lists into a single sorted list.

- **CircularLinkedList.java**  
  A circular singly linked list where the last node points back to the head, enabling continuous traversal.

## 🔧 Features

- Insertion, Deletion, and Traversal methods
- Custom merge logic for sorted lists
- Circular pointer logic for circular list
- Simple console output for testing and demonstration

## 🛠 Technologies

- Java SE 8+
- Object-Oriented Programming principles

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP.
2. Open the project in any Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse).
3. Compile and run the individual `.java` files using the main method provided.
